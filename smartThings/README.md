This page provides a step-by-step tutorial to integrate a blockchain SmartApp with Xooa's blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS).

The repository used in this example is <https://github.com/Xooa/samples>

# Overview

This repository contains the blockchain smart contract (sometimes also called "chaincode") and the SmartThings SmartApp. You'll deploy the smart contract via the Xooa console and the SmartApp via the SmartThings IDE.

Using Xooa, provide a permanent cloud end-point for a SmartThings app, enable cloud-to-cloud integration while maintaining the peer-to-peer capabilities of blockchain.

## Deploy the SmartThings smart contract 

 
1. Log in to Xooa at <https://xooa.com/blockchain>

2. Navigate to **Apps**, then **Deploy New**.

3. Select **Xooa Git Repos**, and then click **Next**.

4. Select the branch (usually **master**) and **Xooa-smartThings** as the Smart Contract, and then click **Deploy**.

5. Relax:  Xooa is doing the blockchain heavy lifting. You'll be redirected to app dashboard when the deployment completes.

6. Copy and save the **API Token** shown in the prompt. You will require this to authorize API requests to the Xooa app. You can also regenerate token from the **Identities** tab.

## Set up the logger SmartApp (SmartThings IDE)

1. Log in with your Samsung SmartThings account to the SmartThings IDE at <https://graph.api.SmartThings.com>.

2. From the menu, click **My SmartApps**.

You now need to publish the app.  You can do this with or without GitHub integration:

**Without GitHub integration:**

1. Click **New SmartApp**.

2. Copy the *groovy* script from the smartThings folder of the  **samples** repo: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xooa/samples/master/smartThings/blockchain-event-logger.groovy>
    
3. On the **From code** tab, paste the code.

4. Click **Create**.

5. Click **Save** and then click **Publish > For me**.

**With GitHub integration** (if you haven't already set up GitHub to work with SmartThings, here is the community FAQ on the subject <https://community.SmartThings.com/t/faq-github-integration-how-to-add-and-update-from-repositories/39046>)

1. From the menu, click **My SmartApps** and then click **Settings**.   
2. Click **Add new repository**.
3.  Add the GitHub repo to your IDE with the following parameters:
    * `Owner`: xooa
    * `Name`: samples
    * `Branch`: master
4. Click **Save**.
5. Click **Update from Repo**.
6. Click **samples (master)**.
7. Select **blockchain-event-logger.groovy** from the **New (only in GitHub)** column.
8.  Select **Publish**.
9.  Click  **Execute Update**.


There are two apps available for SmartThings in the Google Play store. We recommend the classic app over the new app.

## Event Logger SmartApp Setup (Smartphone)
Before you begin, ensure that you:

* Have the SmartThings app installed on your phone
* Have at least one location and one device defined
* Are using the same login ID as your developer account


### SmartThings Classic App (Preferred)

1. Open the SmartThings app and tap **automation**.

2. Tap the SmartApps tab on top.

3. Tap **Add a SmartApp**.

4. Scroll to the last entry and then tap **My Apps**.

5. Tap the `Blockchain Event Logger` app.

6. Select the devices you want logging on your blockchain.

7. Enter the **Xooa API token** you noted earlier.

9. Click **Save**.

### SmartThings New App

1. Tap `automations` in lower bar.

6. Tap it to continue setting it up.

7. Select which devices you want to log in the Xooa blockchain.

8. Enter the **Xooa API token** provided in Xooa dashboard under `Identities`.

## Event Viewer SmartApp Setup (SmartThings IDE)

Follow the same steps as `Event Logger SmartApp Setup (SmartThings IDE)` but:

1. Use `blockchain-event-viewer.groovy` instead of `blockchain-event-logger.groovy` from **samples** GitHub repo.

2. Skip `Event Logger SmartApp Configuration` steps.
